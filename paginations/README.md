TODO:

- the content of 1KG13607/1KG14011.json and 1KG13607/1KG14015.json, one of them is wrong
- same for 1GS66030/1GS66180.json and 1GS66030/1GS66181.json
- 22084/0891.json is missing the new files that were reimported (see https://github.com/buda-base/library-issues/issues/259)
- 1KG13126/I1KG13246.json is very weird (for images > 1000)
- the following have the same pagination multiple times, they should be split in different pagination sections:
   * 4CZ7445/1KG9975.json
   * 1KG13607/1KG14057.json
